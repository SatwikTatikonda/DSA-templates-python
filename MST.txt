Minimum Spanning tree is a subset of the edge-weighted undirecred connected graph that contects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge  weight

a graph can be turned into multiple spanning trees but can have only one uniq MST

As it doest have cycle it is called as trees


Strongly Connected Component

SCC is a Component in wch we can reach every component from every other vertex in that component
